It's conventional to store these references in variables named ```fig``` and ```axs```. We can then plot in each of those sets of axes independently. These subplots are, by default, entirely separate and can have different formatting, types etc.\n","\n","We can add a title to the group of plots using the command ```fig.suptitle()```, providing the desired title as a string argument.\n","\n","Sometimes, by default, axis labels, etc may be hidden by other subplots. Correct spacing can be enforced by using ```fig.tight_layout()```. However, if setting a ```suptitle```, this won't be taken into account by ```tight_layout```. This can cause the title to overlap the plots. To get around this, we can use the fact that we can specify the part of the figure that ```tight_layout``` can work with by specify the ```rect``` optional argument. This should be a sequence of four values which specify the left extent, bottom extent, right extent and top extent as a value between 0 and 1. So, if we wanted to constrain the ```tight_layout``` to only use the left half of the figure and not the bottom 10% (for some reason) we might use the sequence ```[0, 0.1, 0.5, 1]```.\n","\n","As we may be placing several adjacent plots into the same row, it can also be useful to manually specify the height and width of the figure so the subplots have the desired aspect ratio.

We can then add subplots to this figure using the ```fig.add_subplot``` command ([manual page](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html)). There are a couple of ways we can specify the location of the subplot. The most common is to specify three arguments. The first is the number of rows of subplots, the second is the number of columns of subplots. The third is the number of the subplot, counting from left to right, then top to bottom (beginning at 1). So, to insert a subplot at the top-right of a grid of suplots with three rows and two columns we would use the arguments ```3,2,2```.
