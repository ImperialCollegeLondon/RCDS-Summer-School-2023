However, at some point, you'll probably want to use these figures in publications, posters or your thesis. Thus, being able to save your figures to a file to use elsewhere is vital.\n","\n","This can be achieved using the ```plt.savefig``` command ([manual page](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.savefig.html)) if you're plotting without explicitly creating a figure and axes. The first argument for this should be a file name (including a path if appropriate). The format of the file to be saved is determined by the extension of the specified filename.\n","\n","Note that, if you're running Python on your own computer, such as in Anaconda, the file paths are relative to the location of the Notebook or Python script. If you're using Colab or Codespaces, it will be saved in the file system of the virtual machine hosting them.

We can create multiple different figures and sets of axes an save them individually using different filenames. The easiest way to do this is use the ```plt.subplots``` command.
