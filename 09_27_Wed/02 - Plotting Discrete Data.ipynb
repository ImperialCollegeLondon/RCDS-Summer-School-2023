This is in contrast to continuous data, where data can take any value. In this notebook, we'll look at some examples of different types of plots for discrete data. We'll keep the complexity of plots relatively simple for now, and build up more complexity in later notebooks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BCtJL7_z78GJ"},"source":["## Bar Plot\n","\n","We can use a simple bar plot from Matplotlib. To do this, we first need to import the relevant part of Matplotlib using ```import matplotlib.pyplot```. Assuming we import this as ```plt```, a bar plot can be inserted using ```plt.bar```. The manual page can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html). Manual pages for particular plot types can be invaluable for explaining exactly how they work or learning about new options or functionality.\n","\n","Following that, we can set up our data. For now, we'll just manually specify lists containing the names of the categories and their values. However, this data can be generated from any source, such as as the result of a calculation, simulation or analysis of more complex data.\n","\n","We're using Maplotlib in a fairly simple way here, so we can change the label on the x-axis, y-axis and the title by setting ```plt.xlabel```, ```plt.ylabel``` and ```plt.title``` respectively. The way we're using Matplotlib in this example, there is only one figure being created, and this will set these properties of it.\n","\n","Finally, to plot the bar graph, we write ```plt.bar``` and provide to it the names of the categories and the values associated with each as arguments."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"r0DUET7SqdGS"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import matplotlib\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# Set up the categories\n","x = [\"Maths\", \"Physics\", \"Biology\", \"Chemistry\", \"Medicine\", \"Computing\"]\n","# Set up the values\n","y = [10, 20, 32, 15, 27, 18]\n","\n","# Set up the label for x-axis\n","plt.xlabel(\"Subject\")\n","# Set up the label for the y-axis\n","plt.ylabel(\"Number of Students\")\n","# Set up the title of the chart\n","plt.title(\"Favourite Subject\")\n","\n","# Plot the bar chart\n","plt.bar(x, y)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Gzc60KVx-fCI"},"source":["## Stacked Bar Charts\n","\n","When using multiple plotting commands such as ```plt.bar``` they will be superimposed on the same figure.
