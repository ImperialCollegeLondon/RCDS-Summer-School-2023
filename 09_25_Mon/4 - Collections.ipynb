Experiment with different operators and assignments on variables with these types to see which will create a new object and which won't. Can you work out (or make an educated guess) which of these types of mutable and immutable? What happens when you independently assign the same value to two separate ```int``` objects (i.e. don't assign either ```int``` to the other)? Can you think why might Python do this?"
