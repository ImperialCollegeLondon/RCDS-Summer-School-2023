For example, if we were looking at the temperature of a sample in a chemistry lab, we might want to know what the maximum temperature was during the course of an experiment. We might have some data which looks something like this:\n",

For example, we can zoom in on the time period between 3 and 7 hours and plot the actual temperature alongside the data points recorded:\n",
