Deciding which data type, is important part of program design."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EUdmV4XIyD8r"},"source":["## Variable Names\n","In Python there are restrictions on the name of variables. These include:\n","- Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character ```_```\n","- Variable names can only contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore character (e.g. ```a```-```z```, ```A```-```Z```, ```0-9``` and ```_```)\n","- Variable names are case sensitive (e.g ```x1``` is a different name to ```X1``` and variables with both names may exist at the same time)\n","- Variable names may not use reserved keywords which typically have a special function in the language\n","\n","The full list of reserved keywords in Python 3 is:\n","\n","||||||\n","|-|-|-|-|-|\n","| and | except | lambda | with | as|\n","| finally | nonlocal | while | assert | False |\n","| None | yield | break | for | not | \n","| class | from | or | continue | global |\n","| pass | def | if | raise | del |\n","| import | return | elif | in | True |\n","| else | is | try| | |\n","\n","Fortunately, most places you might write Python code, including Jupyter notebooks, will highlight whenever you use a restricted keyword.
