Most collcetions, including lists and strings are iterable. \"Iterable\" means \"able to give a sequence of values one after another\". It's this feature which allows a for loop to extract the values of the loop variables one by one.\n","\n","We begin by making a list, which is an example of an iterable type. We then use the syntax\n","\n","```python\n","for item in my_list:\n","```\n","\n","to declare that we are performing a loop with ```item``` as the loop variable and that we want ```item``` to take the value of each entry in ```my_list``` in turn.

This code is marked by the fact that it is indented (use the tab button on your keyboard). All indented code will be carried out from top to bottom for each iteration. Then, the value of ```item``` will be changed to the next value and the indented code will be run again.

However, sometimes you want to loop over a range of numbers without saving them to a list first. For this, the ```range``` type is very useful. You may create a ```range``` object using the following syntax:\n","\n","```python\n","r=range(start_number, stop_number, step)\n","```\n","\n","In this construction, ```start_number``` gives the first value that will be returned by the range when it is iterated over, ```stop_number``` gives the first number that will not be returned (i.e. the range will stop iterating just before this number) and the ```step``` gives the difference between subsequent returned values. \n","\n","In this construction, both ```start_number``` and ```step``` are optional.\n","\n","If one argument is given, it will be assumed to be the ```stop_number```.
