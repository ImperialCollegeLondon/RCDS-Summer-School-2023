## Day 5
Welcome to Day 5.

### Hackathon (Friday afternoon)

Work in pairs, small groups or solo, as you like.

Please make use of the tutors to discuss your ideas and ask for suggestions etc. - we are here to help you!

We will get together at the end of the day to take a look at what you have made!

You have options:

A. Data Science Project

* Continue working on the Earthquakes Task.
* Choose a data set that interests you and prepare a report including plots and statistical analysis as appropriate.
* Create a tool to retrieve and visualise data from an API of your choice.

B. Programming Project

* Continue working on the Connect 4 Task.
* Choose your own project - some suggestions [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-projects-for-beginners/).

When you have something interesting to show, paste a screenshot to [Padlet](https://padlet.com/jpinney5/rcds-summer-school-2023-qhj9p1mk247jevvh) and include a short explanation of your project.
