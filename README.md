## Opening a Codespace

A [Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) is a development environment hosted by GitHub directly from a repository. To use this, you will need to be signed into a GitHub account. To open the Codespace, click the green ```Code``` button at the top right of the repository. Make sure you're in the ```Codespaces``` tab and click the ```Create New Codespace on main``` button. This will create a Codespace of your own. This will take a minute or so to initialise. You may be asked to reload the page. If so, do reload the page.

Once your Codespace has initialised, it will remain associated with your GitHub account for around a month, when it will expire. Your Codespace will be given a name like "fuzzy-barnacle" so you can identify it. To reopen it on a future occasion, click the ```Code``` button again, then select the Codespace, click ```Open```, then ```Open in Browser```.

To download the content of the files within the Codespace, open the Files tab on the left, select the files, right click and click ```Download``` button. Alternatively, if you're familiar with GitHub, you can open the source control tab on the left, you can commit and push changes. This will fork the repository with your changes. Either of these options will allow you to keep a copy of the course notes with your solutions to the exercises, etc.
