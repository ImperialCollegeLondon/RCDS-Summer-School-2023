# RCDS Summer School 2023
#### Imperial College London

## Welcome!
Welcome to the [RCDS](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/) Summer School 2023! We are delighted to have you with us for a week. Please check the [full schedule here](https://blogs.imperial.ac.uk/postgraduatenoticeboard/files/2023/08/RCDS_summer_school.pdf).

We will use this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F0KwAudaHwi-E_zTldOAD_0bz4jzz6WJFt3h889yhNw/edit) to share links and other essential info. 

The learning materials are organised by day in this repository. The lessons use Jupyter Notebooks that can be easily open in GitHub Codespaces (instructions in the next section). If you have some experience with Jupyter Notebooks, you can use your favourite application - just make sure that you have the required packages installed. If the last sentence does not make sense, do not worry, it will at the end of the week.



## Opening a Codespace

A [Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) is a development environment hosted by GitHub directly from a repository. To use this, you will need to be signed into a GitHub account. To open the Codespace, click the green ```Code``` button at the top right of the repository. Make sure you're in the ```Codespaces``` tab and click the ```Create New Codespace on main``` button. This will create a Codespace of your own. This will take a minute or so to initialise. You may be asked to reload the page. If so, do reload the page.

Once your Codespace has initialised, it will remain associated with your GitHub account for around a month, when it will expire. Your Codespace will be given a name like "fuzzy-barnacle" so you can identify it. To reopen it on a future occasion, click the ```Code``` button again, then select the Codespace, click ```Open```, then ```Open in Browser```.

To download the content of the files within the Codespace, open the Files tab on the left, select the files, right click and click ```Download``` button. Alternatively, if you're familiar with GitHub, you can open the source control tab on the left, you can commit and push changes. This will fork the repository with your changes. Either of these options will allow you to keep a copy of the course notes with your solutions to the exercises, etc.

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are a great learning tool. They combine two types of content - text and code cells. You will notice that we organised our materials into short explanation blocks followed by a code cell. 

The code cells can be executed using an arrow icon to the left of the cell. Alternative way to execute the cell is to press ```shift``` and ```enter``` at the same time (this is easier done using the right ```shift```). The snippet of code will get executed. If the cell contains a print statement, output will be displayed below. If the code produced an error, the error trace will be shown. The code cells should be executed from top to bottom of the notebook - in case a code snippet depends on a code above.

The text cells in Notebooks are prepared using [Markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).
