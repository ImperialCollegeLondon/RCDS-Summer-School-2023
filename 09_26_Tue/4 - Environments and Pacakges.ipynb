Within \"info\" you will find some information about the environment. We don't need to worry about most of this, but it's worth exploring the \"Version\" briefly.\n",

    "As Python has developed over the years, there have been many versions with a gradually increasing set of functionality. A list of the different versions and their functionality can be found [here](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/). Python is, for the most part, backward compatible in the sense that if a code works with Python 3.7 it will generally run with Python 3.9. But utilising a feature introduced in Python 3.9 and trying to run the code using an environment based on Python 3.7 will not work."
