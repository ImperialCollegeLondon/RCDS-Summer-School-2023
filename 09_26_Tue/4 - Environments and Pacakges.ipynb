A list of the different versions and their functionality can be found [here](https://www.python.org/doc/versions/). Python is, for the most part, backward compatible in the sense that if a code works with Python 3.7 it will generally run with Python 3.9. But utilising a feature introduced in Python 3.9 and trying to run the code using an environment based on Python 3.7 will not work."
