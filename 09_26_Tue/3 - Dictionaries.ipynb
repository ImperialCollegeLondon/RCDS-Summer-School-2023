This is because dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, which are not ordered. In Python 3.6 and later, dictionaries are ordered, so the order of the keys will be the same as the order in which they were added to the dictionary. However, relying on the \"order\" of a dictionary is not normally good practice as it can make your code less portable and tends to encourage design patterns which do not use dictionaries in the best way."

Knowing the number of each of these bases present in a DNA sequence can be useful for some types of genetic analysis.\n",

If a base doesn't appear in the genetic sequence, a key-value pair representing it should still be present in the dictionary, with a value of 0.\n",
