It contains functionality which allows large amounts of data to be handled easily and efficiently.\n","\n","Numpy gives access to complex, high-quality code which you can use in your projects. Using this can save a large amount of time compared to writing code yourself to produce the same results.\n","\n","In addition, the code used in NumPy contains a lot of code written in the programming language C, which is significantly more computationally efficient that Python, allowing it to be faster than even the most well-written Python code could possibly be. The complexities of the interfaces between Python and C is hidden inside the package, meaning we don't need to worry about the complexities of how the interface works.\n","\n","Due to the ease of use and the speed of Numpy, it's widely used in a variety of different applications and disciplines.\n","\n","## Arrays\n","\n","One of the most important constructs in NumPy is the ```array```. An array is an arrangements of data in one or more dimensions. A one-dimensional array is similar to a list in some ways.\n","\n","To create an array, we first need to import the NumPy module into our code. When we do this, it is common to give it the alias ```np```. We can then create an array by writing ```np.array()``` and providing a sequence (such as a list or tuple) of values."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wOEdh9Mk-Pr3"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NhXecD0kJnw_"},"source":["Once we create an array, we cannot change its size or shape.
